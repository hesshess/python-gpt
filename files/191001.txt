On Friday, a lone Microsoft developer revealed a backdoor had been intentionally planted in XZ Utils, an open source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The backdoor manipulated sshd, allowing anyone with a predetermined encryption key to stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. The backdoor was implemented through a five-stage loader that used clever techniques to hide itself. The malicious code was added to XZ Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. The backdoor was nearly merged into Debian and Red Hat distributions before being discovered. The developer behind the backdoor, using the username Jia Tan, spent years on this project, manipulating the open source software to execute the backdoor.
