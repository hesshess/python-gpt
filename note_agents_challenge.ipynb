The person or people behind this project likely\\nspent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update\\nmerged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux, when\\nan eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.\\n\\n\"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we\\'ve seen described in\\nthe open, and it\\'s a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized\\nupstream in a widely used library,\" software and cryptography engineer Filippo\\nValsorda said of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.\\n\\nResearchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here\\'s what we know so\\nfar.\\n\\n## What Is XZ Utils?\\n\\nXZ Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression\\non virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. XZ Utils\\nprovides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all\\nkinds of operations. XZ Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making\\nthis component even more crucial.\\n\\n## What Happened?\\n\\nAndres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL\\nofferings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system\\nwas experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging\\nin to devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too\\nmany CPU cycles and were generating errors with valgrind, a utility for\\nmonitoring computer memory.\\n\\nThrough sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the\\nproblems were the result of updates that had been made to XZ Utils. On Friday,\\nFreund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the\\nresult of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression\\nsoftware.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to overstate the complexity of the social engineering and the inner\\nworkings of the backdoor. Thomas Roccia, a researcher at Microsoft, published\\na graphic on Mastodon that helps visualize the sprawling extent of the nearly\\nsuccessful endeavor to spread a backdoor with a reach that would have dwarfed\\nthe SolarWinds event from 2020.\\n\\n## What Does the Backdoor Do?\\n\\nMalicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the\\nsoftware functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to\\nmake remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined\\nencryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login\\ncertificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has\\nactually seen code uploaded, so it\\'s not known what code the attacker planned\\nto run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including\\nstealing encryption keys or installing malware.\\n\\n## Wait, How Can a Compression Utility Manipulate a Process as Security-\\nSensitive as SSH?\\n\\nAny library can tamper with the inner workings of any executable it is linked\\nagainst. Often, the developer of the executable will establish a link to a\\nlibrary that\\'s needed for it to work properly. OpenSSH, the most popular sshd\\nimplementation, doesn’t link the liblzma library, but Debian and many other\\nLinux distributions add a patch to link sshd to systemd, a program that loads\\na variety of services during the system bootup. Systemd, in turn, links to\\nliblzma, and this allows XZ Utils to exert control over sshd.\\n\\n## How Did This Backdoor Come to Be?\\n\\nIt would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone\\nwith the username JiaT75 made their first known commit to an open source\\nproject. In retrospect, the change to the libarchive project is suspicious,\\nbecause it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that has long been\\nrecognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.\\n\\nArs Technica\\n\\nThis story originally appeared on Ars Technica, a trusted source for\\ntechnology news, tech policy analysis, reviews, and more. Ars is owned by\\nWIRED\\'s parent company, Condé Nast.\\n\\nThe following year, JiaT75 submitted a patch over the XZ Utils mailing list,\\nand, almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar\\njoined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of\\nXZ Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with\\nthe support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a\\npresence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to\\nmaintain the project.\\n\\nIn January 2023, JiaT75 made their first commit to XZ Utils. In the months\\nfollowing, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in\\nXZ Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins’ contact information with\\ntheir own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open source software for\\nvulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz\\ndisable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from\\ndetecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to XZ Utils.\\n\\nIn February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of\\nXZ Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or\\nothers appealed to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the\\nupdates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into\\nseveral releases, according to security firm Tenable. There’s more about Tan\\nand the timeline here.\\n\\n## Can You Say More About What This Backdoor Does?\\n\\nIn a nutshell, it allows someone with the right private key to hijack sshd,\\nthe executable file responsible for making SSH connections, and from there to\\nexecute malicious commands. The backdoor is implemented through a five-stage\\nloader that uses a series of simple but clever techniques to hide itself. It\\nalso provides the means for new payloads to be delivered without major changes\\nbeing required.\\n\\nMultiple people who have reverse-engineered the updates have much more to say\\nabout the backdoor. Developer Sam James provided an overview here.\\n\\nFeatured Video\\n\\n\\n\\nMost Popular\\n\\n  * Science\\n\\nThis Woman Will Decide Which Babies Are Born\\n\\nJason Kehe\\n\\n  * Business\\n\\nBeeper Took On Apple’s iMessage Dominance. Now It’s Been Acquired\\n\\nLauren Goode\\n\\n  * Science\\n\\nThe Best Total Solar Eclipse Photos\\n\\nKaren Williams\\n\\n  * Politics\\n\\nThe Hacking Lawsuit Looming Over Truth Social\\n\\nWilliam Turton\\n\\n  * \\n\\nIn an online interview, developer and reverse engineer HD Moore confirmed the\\nSam James suspicion that the backdoor targeted either Debian or Red Hat\\ndistributions.\\n\\n“The attack was sneaky in that it only did the final steps of the backdoor if\\nyou were building the library on amd64 (intel x86 64-bit) and were building a\\nDebian or a RPM package (instead of using it for a local installation),” he\\nwrote.\\n\\nParaphrasing observations from researchers who collectively spent the weekend\\nanalyzing the malicious updates, he continued:\\n\\n> When verifying an SSH public key, if the public key matches a certain\\n> fingerprint function, the key contents are decrypted using a pre-shared key\\n> before the public key is actually verified. The decrypted contents are then\\n> passed directly to system.\\n>\\n> If the fingerprint doesn\\'t match or the decrypted contents don\\'t match a\\n> certain format, it falls back to regular key verification and no-one\\'s the\\n> wiser.\\n>\\n> The backdoor is super sneaky. It uses a little-known feature of the glibc to\\n> hook a function. It only triggers when the backdoored xz library gets loaded\\n> by a /usr/bin/sshd process on one of the affected distributions. There may\\n> be many other backdoors, but the one everyone is talking about uses the\\n> function indirection stuff to add the hook. The payload was encoded into\\n> fake xz test files and runs as a shellcode effectively, changing the SSH RSA\\n> key verification code so that a magic public key (sent during normal\\n> authentication) let the attacker gain access\\n>\\n> \\u200b\\u200bTheir grand scheme was:\\n>\\n>   1. sneakily backdoor the release tarballs, but not the source code\\n>   2. use sockpuppet accounts to convince the various Linux distributions to\\n> pull the latest version and package it\\n>   3. once those distributions shipped it, they could take over any\\n> downstream user/company system/etc\\n>\\n\\nResearchers from networking firm Akamai also explain well how the backdoor\\nworks here.\\n\\n## What More Do We Know About Jia Tan?\\n\\nAt the moment, extremely little, especially for someone entrusted to steward a\\npiece of software as ubiquitous and as sensitive as XZ Utils. This developer\\npersona has touched dozens of other pieces of open source software in the past\\nfew years. At the moment, it’s unknown if there was ever a real-world person\\nbehind this username or if Jia Tan is a completely fabricated individual.\\n\\nAdditional technical analysis is available from the above Bluesky thread from\\nValsorda, researcher Kevin Beaumont, and Freund’s Friday disclosure.\\n\\n## Is There a CVE Tracking Designation?\\n\\nYes, it\\'s CVE-2024-3094.\\n\\n## How Do I Know If the Backdoor Is Present on My Device?\\n\\nThere are several ways. One is this page from security firm Binarly. The tool\\ndetects implementation of IFUNC and is based on behavioral analysis. It can\\nautomatically detect invariants in the event a similar backdoor is implanted\\nelsewhere.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a project called xzbot.
